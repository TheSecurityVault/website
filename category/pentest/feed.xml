      <description>Some days ago I found an Open Redirect in Facebook website, that I promptly reported to their Bug Bounty Program. There were a lot of warnings that Open Redirect&amp;rsquo;s are usually false positives, but this one looked legit to me.
Facebook disregarded the report, saying that wasn&amp;rsquo;t exploitable as there are protections in place against it.
So this is a blog post of a &amp;ldquo;not&amp;rdquo; open redirect issue in Facebook.</description>

      <description>This time i&amp;rsquo;m not going to talk about a specific vulnerability. Instead I&amp;rsquo;m going to show how attackers disguise malware in order to bypass antivirus.
Antivirus 101 To start, we need to understand how AV works.
I&amp;rsquo;m just going to touch on the basics, but they should be enough to understand the logic behind all of this.
To know that a malware is actually a malware the AV checks an internal database where it stores what is called a signature.</description>
