      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some days ago I found an Open Redirect in Facebook website, that I promptly reported to their Bug Bounty Program. There were a lot of warnings that Open Redirect&amp;rsquo;s are usually false positives, but this one looked legit to me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Facebook disregarded the report, saying that wasn&amp;rsquo;t exploitable as there are protections in place against it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So this is a blog post of a &amp;ldquo;not&amp;rdquo; open redirect issue in Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This time i&amp;rsquo;m not going to talk about a specific vulnerability. Instead I&amp;rsquo;m going to show how attackers disguise malware in order to bypass antivirus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;antivirus-101&#34;&gt;Antivirus 101&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To start, we need to understand how AV works.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m just going to touch on the basics, but they should be enough to understand the logic behind all of this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To know that a malware is actually a malware the AV checks an internal database where it stores what is called a signature. This signature is a peace of the malware, that should be unique to that program. In a lot of scenarios these signatures are strings or checksum hashes from the binaries.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
