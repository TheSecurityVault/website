About TheSecurityVault

On a regular basis I'm confronted with a lot of AppSec vulnerabilities which are quite unknown and good documentation about it is scarce.

To show what a vulnerability is, how it happens or how to fix it is sometimes hard due to the this lack of articles.

I decided to create TheSecurityVault to share my knowledge about these not well known vulnerabilities, a place where you can find the answers that you need, from when/how the vulnerability happens, how to exploit it and how to fix it, from start to finish, in a single place. This is a website for the common developer to understand what can go wrong about subjects that due to their 'low' or neglected impact are not taken in consideration or are not written much about. Hope you like it :D
