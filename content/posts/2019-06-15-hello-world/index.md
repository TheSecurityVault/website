"What hath God wrought?"  
"Mr. Watson--come here--I want to see you."  
"Tere, kas sa kuuled mind?"  
"QWERTYUIOP"  
"just setting up my twttr"  
"Merry Christmas."  
"Houston"  
"Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace to men of good will."  
"Wait a minute, wait a minute, I tell yer, you ain't heard nothin"  
  
These are all probably just best sentences to start the first blog post then the ones I imagined so I'm leaving them all here  
  
There's not much to say... TheSecurityVault is finally alive, and I hope you all enjoy its contents :D
